                    <p>
                      When you use Ticket Tailor for selling tickets and
                      collecting data from your attendees you are the “data
                      controller” of all your attendees’ data. We are a “data
                      processor”, which means that we won’t do anything with
                      your attendees’ data other than what you need us to in
                      order to provide our service. We won’t be sending your
                      attendees any marketing emails, sharing their data with
                      anyone and if you want us to delete the data, just ask.
                      It’s your data. 100

                      The servers and databases that power Ticket Tailor are

                      number of third parties, some of which are outside of the
                      EU, to provide our ticketing service and we have contracts
                      with each of them that oblige them to comply with the
                      GDPR. You can find the full list of these third parties
