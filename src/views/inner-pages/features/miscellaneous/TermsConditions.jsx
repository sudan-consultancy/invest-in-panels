                    or boycott. <br /> <br /> Cessation of Operation. Vefes may at any time,
                    in its sole discretion and without advance notice to you,
                    cease operation of the Website and sale of the Products. <br /> <br />
                    Entire Agreement. This Agreement comprises the entire
                    agreement between you and Vefes and supersedes any prior
                    agreements pertaining to the subject matter contained
                    herein. <br /> <br /> Effect of Waiver. The failure of Vefes to exercise
                    or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement will not
                    constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any
                    provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent
                    jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree
                    that the court should endeavor to give effect to the
                    parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the
                    other provisions of this Agreement remain in full force and
                    effect.  <br /> <br />Statute of Limitation. You agree that regardless of
                    any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of
                    action arising out of or related to use of the Website or
                    this Agreement must be filed within one (1) year after such
                    claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. <br /> <br /> Waiver
                    of Class Action Rights. BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU
                    HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT YOU MAY HAVE TO JOIN
                    CLAIMS WITH THOSE OF OTHER IN THE FORM OF A CLASS ACTION OR
                    SIMILAR PROCEDURAL DEVICE. ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF,
                    RELATING TO, OR CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT MUST BE
                    ASSERTED INDIVIDUALLY. <br /> <br />
                    <h4> Termination</h4>  <br /> Vefes reserves the right
                    to terminate your access to the Website if it reasonably
                    believes, in its sole discretion, that you have breached any
                    of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Following
                    termination, you will not be permitted to use the Website
                    and Vefes may, in its sole discretion and without advance
                    notice to you, cancel any outstanding orders for Products.
                    If your access to the Website is terminated, Vefes reserves
                    the right to exercise whatever means it deems necessary to
                    prevent unauthorized access of the Website. This Agreement
                    will survive indefinitely unless and until Vefes chooses, in
                    its sole discretion and without advance to you, to terminate
                    it. <br /> <br />
                    <h4> Assignment</h4> <br /> You may not assign your rights and
                    obligations under this Agreement to anyone. Vefes may assign
                    its rights and obligations under this Agreement in its sole
                    discretion and without advance notice to you.<br /><br /> BY USING THIS
                    WEBSITE OR ORDERING PRODUCTS FROM THIS WEBSITE YOU AGREE TO
                    BE BOUND BY ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS
                    AGREEMENT.
