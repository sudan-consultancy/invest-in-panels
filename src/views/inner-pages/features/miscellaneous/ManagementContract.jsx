                          subsections (a) and (b) of this Section, the
                          Indemnitee shall promptly give the Indemnifying Party

                          provisions for indemnification contained in this
                          Agreement. Except as provided below, the Indemnifying
                          Party may compromise, settle or defend, at such
                          Indemnifying Party's own expense and by such
                          Indemnifying Party's own counsel, any such matter
                          involving the asserted liability of the Indemnitee. In
                          any event, the Indemnitee, the Indemnifying Party and
                          the Indemnifying Party's counsel shall cooperate in
                          the compromise of, or defense against, any such
                          asserted liability. If the Indemnifying Party provides
                          the Indemnitee a defense to a third party claim at the
                          Indemnifying Party's cost with a qualified attorney,
                          Indemnitee may participate and/or monitor the defense

                          Indemnifying Party pays for the full cost of the
                          settlement of any claim, the Indemnifying Party may
                          settle any claim without the consent of the
                          Indemnitee. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to
                          defend any claim, the Indemnitee shall make available
                          to the Indemnifying Party any books, records or other
                          documents within its control that are necessary or
