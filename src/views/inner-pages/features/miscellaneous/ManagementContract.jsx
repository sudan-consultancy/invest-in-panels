                        the commencement of the term of this Management
                        Agreement. The obligations set forth in this Section
                        10(b) shall survive for a period of one (1) year
                        following the Expiration Date.

                      <li>
                        If a party entitled to indemnification (the
                        "Indemnitee") receives notice of any claim or the
                        commencement of any action or proceeding with respect to
                        which a party is obligated to provide indemnification
                        (the "Indemnifying Party") pursuant to subsections (a)
                        and (b) of this Section, the Indemnitee shall promptly
                        give the Indemnifying Party notice thereof
                        (Indemnification Notice"). Such Indemnification Notice
                        shall be a condition precedent to any liability of the
                        Indemnifying Party under the provisions for
                        indemnification contained in this Agreement. Except as
                        provided below, the Indemnifying Party may compromise,
                        settle or defend, at such Indemnifying Party's own
                        expense and by such Indemnifying Party's own counsel,
                        any such matter involving the asserted liability of the
                        Indemnitee. In any event, the Indemnitee, the
                        Indemnifying Party and the Indemnifying Party's counsel
                        shall cooperate in the compromise of, or defense
                        against, any such asserted liability. If the
                        Indemnifying Party provides the Indemnitee a defense to
                        a third party claim at the Indemnifying Party's cost
                        with a qualified attorney, Indemnitee may participate
                        and/or monitor the defense with an attorney of the
                        Indemnitee's selection (at the Indemnitee's own
                        expense). Provided that the Indemnifying Party pays for
                        the full cost of the settlement of any claim, the
                        Indemnifying Party may settle any claim without the
                        consent of the Indemnitee. If the Indemnifying Party
                        chooses to defend any claim, the Indemnitee shall make
                        available to the Indemnifying Party any books, records
                        or other documents within its control that are necessary
                        or appropriate for such defense.
