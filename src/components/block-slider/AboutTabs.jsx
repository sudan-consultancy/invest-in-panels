              Being a climate enthusiast we were always intrigued by solar energy. Although while pushing this idea ahead with our Power Plant under Project Livania, in our journey we realised that common people wanted to participate in green energy but they could not due to the high cost factor required for setting up a Power Plant. That is when we came up with an innovative concept of fractional ownership of Power Plant by giving the people a chance to own individual solar panels. Under this ownership of solar panels the participants receive an annual  guaranteed rental income at a lucrative rate of return.
